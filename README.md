# C-programming-Assignments
This repo consists of a few assignments done by me during my third semester. 
Assignment 1 : This assignment is about a music-streaming system like Spotify with features like each song being identified by a unique id, having a playlist (adding and deleting songs),
                a playqueue and shuffling of songs.
